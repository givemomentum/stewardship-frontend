            <li class="sub-list-item">By entering into these Terms and using the Services, you hereby appoint Momentum to act as your agent for facilitation and transfer of your Donations via our Payment Service Provider(s), chosen at our discretion.</li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Payments and Donations. You must provide Momentum with a valid payment method as a condition to signing up for the Services or making a Donation. You agree to pay all payment service fees or charges to your payment accounts in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable under the Donation Schedule, defined in Section 3.4. Until that time, neither Momentum nor its Payment Service Provider(s) (defined in Section 3.6) will reserve any charges against your accounts, or hold any Donation amounts on your behalf or on behalf of any Group. By providing your payment information to Momentum, you agree that (i) Momentum’s Payment Service Provider, as applicable, is authorized to charge your account for all fees and charges due and payment hereunder, and for any Donations you agree to make by using the Services; and (ii) no additional notice or consent is required for such charges. You agree to immediately notify Momentum of any change in your billing address or the payment method used for payments hereunder. Momentum reserves the right at any time to change its billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the
              Application, or by e-mail delivery to you.</li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Donation Schedule. Certain features of the Services allow you to make automatic recurring Donations in accordance with the schedule set forth at the time you opt-in to that recurring Donation (“Donation Schedule”). When you opt-in by selecting a trigger, you are making a pledge to make a Donation; your account will not be charged at that time. You authorize Momentum’s Payment Service Provider(s) to fulfill your pledge and charge any Donation amounts accrued to your account, in accordance with the applicable Donation Schedule. You can change your Donation Schedule at any time via your account settings on the Application or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@givemomentum.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">contact@givemomentum.com.</a> Any change to your Donation Schedule will be effective immediately with respect to any Donations scheduled after the date of such change. Your account will be charged on or after the 1st day of each month for Donations triggered in the previous month. Once your account has been charged, all Donations are non-refundable.</li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Purchase Categories. Certain features of the Services may allow you to select certain purchases made by you to trigger Donations through the Services. We use third-party services to group merchants into categories based on the kinds of products and services that the merchant sells. You can select these categories to trigger a Donation when a purchase is made with a merchant in such category. Momentum and our third-party partners make every effort to accurately categorize your purchases, however, even though a merchant or the items or services sold by such merchant may appear to fit within a certain category, the third-party service that we use may categorize the merchant in a different category than you expected, which may result in a Donation being triggered by your Donation Schedule.
            </li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Third-Party Payment Services Provider. If Momentum acts as your agent to for the facilitation and transfer of your Donations to a Group, Momentum will process your payments and Donations using third-party service providers such as Stripe (each a “Payment Service Provider”).

Users will be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to such Payment Service Provider, and Users will be responsible for paying agreed-upon payments and Donations for the Services. Users may be required to register with the Payment Service Provider, agree to a Payment Service Provider Account Agreement and the terms of service of the Payment Service Provider and go through a vetting process at the request of the Payment Service Provider to set up their account with the Payment Service Provider. By making a payment or Donation using the Services, you agree and acknowledge that we are bound by such Payment Service Provider’s terms and conditions, and that you are bound by the Payment Service Provider’s terms and conditions and privacy policy to the extent applicable. As a condition of Momentum enabling payment processing services through the Payment Service Provider, you agree to provide accurate and complete information about you and/or your business (as applicable). You also hereby consent and authorize Momentum to delegate the authorizations and to share the information you provide to Momentum with our Payment Service Provider(s), to the extent required to provide

              payment services to you. Your payment information is automatically transferred to the Payment Service Provider, and Momentum does not see or store any such information. Momentum reserves the right (but not the obligation), in its sole discretion, to (i) place on hold any payment and out of pocket expenses, or (ii) refund, provide credits or arrange for the Payment Service Provider to do so.</li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Donations to Charities. When you choose to support a Charity, Momentum, as your agent, and via the Payment Service Provider, may send your Donations to a DAF Sponsor, chosen at our discretion. You understand and agree that your Donation may go to the Momentum Fund, a DAF held by a DAF Sponsor, that the Charities you prefer to support will be reviewed and approved by the DAF Sponsor at its discretion and in accordance with its agreement with Momentum, and that, if approved, the DAF Sponsor will distribute your Donations to the Charities you prefer. If for any reason the DAF Sponsor does not distribute your Donations to the Charities you prefer, the DAF Sponsor, in consultation with Momentum, will redirect your Donations to another organization or organizations similar to your preferred Charities. You further understand and agree, and certify at all times you use the Services, that no Donation in support of a Charity may or will be used to discharge or satisfy your legally enforceable pledges or obligations, or to provide you with a more than incidental benefit, as provided in the IRC and Treasury Regulations applicable to DAFs.</li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Donations to Social Welfare Organizations. Donors may have the opportunity as part of the Services to support a Charity’s related social welfare affiliate or other Social Welfare Organization. When you choose to support a Social Welfare Organization, Momentum, as your agent and via the Payment Service Provider, may send your Donations either directly to a Social Welfare Organization or to a Social Welfare Sponsor, chosen at our discretion, that will accept and distribute your Donations to your preferred Social Welfare Organization, subject to the approval of the Social Welfare Sponsor. If for any reason the Social Welfare Sponsor does not distribute your Donations to the Social Welfare Organizations you prefer, the Social Welfare Sponsor, in consultation with Momentum, will redirect your Donations to another organization or organizations similar to your preferred Social Welfare Organization. You further understand and agree, and certify at all times you use the Services, that all Donations for social welfare activities using the Services are solely for general support of the recipient.</li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Donations to Political Organizations. Donors may have the opportunity as part of the Services to directly fund Political Organizations. When you choose to support a Political Organization, Momentum as your agent and via the Payment Service Provider, may send your Donations to the Political Organization you prefer, subject to any conditions or disclaimers reflected on the Political Organization’s solicitation. You understand and agree, and certify at all times you use the Services, that all Donations for Political Organizations will be used for political purposes and that no Donations solicited for any political purpose, or otherwise with reference to influencing any election, will be distributed to any Charity. Donations to Political Organizations may result in your disclosure as a donor by the Political Organization. You are solely responsible for understanding
              and complying with all donor disclosure obligations. We have no obligation to inform you of any disclosure obligations that you may have, and we will not undertake to do so, or to provide any third party (other than a recipient Political Organization) with information about your donations, except to the extent that we may be specifically required by law to do so.</li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Donation Receipts. You will receive a receipt for each Donation that you make via the Services by email from Momentum. You may also request a donation receipt for all of your Donations made to the Momentum Fund for your records by contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@givemomentum.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">contact@givemomentum.com.</a> Momentum makes no guarantees, representations or warranties regarding the tax-deductibility of any Donation, the sufficiency of any such receipts for substantiating charitable contribution deductions, or the tax-exempt status of any Group. You understand that Donations to Social Welfare Organizations, Social Welfare Sponsors, and Political Organizations are not tax-deductible as charitable contributions. Please consult your personal tax advisor with regard to any questions on the tax-deductibility of any Donation.
            </li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Service Fees. The Payment Service Provider, DAF Sponsor, Social Welfare Sponsor, or other Donation intermediary may charge service fees for processing, accepting, and distributing your Donations (“Service Fees”). When Donations are made via the Application, Momentum commits to paying or reimbursing those Service Fees, so as to not reduce the amount of your Donations ultimately distributed to your preferred Groups, as approved by the DAF Sponsor or Social Welfare Sponsor, as applicable. If you use the Services via a Group Site, such Group may, at its discretion, charge additional fees to cover the Service Fees. Any additional fees will be reflected in the donation flow prior to your confirmation of payment. For providing its Services to you, Momentum will not automatically charge a fee, but will accept voluntary tips, paid directly to Momentum; such tips are not tax-deductible.

          Governing Law; Agreement to Arbitrate
          <ol class="sub-list">
            <li class="sub-list-item">Choice of Law. These Terms and the rights of the parties hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).</li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Arbitration. To the extent feasible, the parties desire to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to your use of Momentum and these Terms, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitration (a “Dispute”) through discussions and negotiations between each other. The parties agree to attempt to resolve any Disputes by negotiation with the other party (by phone, electronic correspondence, or written correspondence). If, after good faith discussions, the Dispute(s) cannot be resolved solely between the parties, such Dispute(s) will be determined by arbitration in the English language in San Francisco County, California before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”) of JAMS, which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason. You agree that the state or federal courts sitting in San Francisco County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. This provision will not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
            </li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Conduct of Arbitration. The arbitration will be commenced by the claimant party filing a demand for arbitration with JAMS and serving the demand on the opposing party. Within 30 calendar days of the date the demand for arbitration is filed, the parties will select an arbitrator by following the Rules’ arbitrator selection procedures. Except as may be required by law, neither party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration under these Terms without the prior written consent of both parties. The arbitrator’s award will be in writing, in the English language, and accompanied by a reasoned opinion and a written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
            </li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Costs; Judgment. The arbitrator will determine how the costs and expenses of the arbitration will be allocated between the parties, and may award attorneys’ fees. Each party shall bear the burden of its own counsel fees incurred in connection with any arbitration proceedings. Judgment upon the award returned by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or their assets or application of enforcement, as the case may be. Any award by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties. The parties hereby waive all rights to judicial review of the arbitrator’s decision and any award contained therein.</li>

            <li class="sub-list-item">Service Discontinuance/Modification. We may from time to time modify or discontinue access to,
              temporarily or permanently, any part, feature, or functionality of Momentum. We will not be liable for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance, even if certain features or functions, your settings, and/or any User Content you have contributed or have come to rely on, are permanently lost.</li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Advertising. Momentum may display advertisements or announcements, and you consent to such display.
            </li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Trademarks; Media. You are granted no right, title or license to any third-party trademarks by these Terms, or to any of our trademarks or servicemarks. We reserve all right, title and interest in and to our trademarks, servicemarks, trade names, domain names, and similar identifiers, including “Momentum”.</li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">California-Based. Momentum is controlled by Better Good, Inc. from its offices in California, USA. We make no representation that Momentum is appropriate for use in other jurisdictions. Your use of or access to Momentum will not be construed as our purposefully availing ourselves of the

              benefits or privileges of doing business in any other state or jurisdiction other than California.</li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Assignment. These Terms will not be assigned, delegated, or transferred by you, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by merger, consolidation, dissolution, sale of assets, or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any such purported assignment, delegation or transfer without such written consent will be void. We may at any time assign these Terms without prior consent or notice. These Terms will be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, the parties and their respective and permitted successors and assigns.
            </li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Injunctive Relief. You acknowledge and agree that breach of these Terms, or any unauthorized use, disclosure or distribution of Momentum, may cause irreparable harm to us, the extent of which would be difficult to ascertain, and that we will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief (in addition to any other available remedies), in any court of competent jurisdiction under the applicable laws thereto.</li>
            <li class="sub-list-item">Miscellaneous. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us and govern your use of Momentum, superseding any prior agreements, understandings, communications or proposals. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of these Terms will be deemed a further waiver or continuing waiver or such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these Terms and any Momentum website page (including any page describing or summarizing your or our rights, obligations, and/or these Terms), these Terms will control. Except as expressly provided herein, nothing herein will be deemed to create an agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship of any kind between us and any User or other person or entity, nor do these terms extend rights to any third party. The parties hereto confirm that they have requested that these Terms and all attachments and related documents, if any, be drafted in English.</li>
