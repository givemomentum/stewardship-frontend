          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Our Responsibilities</span>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.1. Provision of Momentum Services</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Supplier will (a) make the Momentum Services, Content and Client Data available to
        a Client pursuant to these Terms, (b) provide applicable standard support for the
        Momentum Services to Client at no additional charge, and/or upgraded support (for
        an additional charge, if applicable), (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to
        make the Momentum Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          planned downtime (of which Supplier shall give advance electronic notice as
          provided in any applicable Guidelines),
        </li>

        <li>
          (ii) any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Supplier’s reasonable
          control, including, for example, an act of God, act of government, flood, fire,
          earthquake, civil unrest, act of terror, strike or other labor problem, Internet
          service provider failure or delay, or denial of service attack.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>4.2. Protection of Client Data</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Supplier will maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for
        protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Client Data, as
        described in the Guidelines. Those safeguards will include, but will not be
        limited to, measures for preventing access, use, modification or disclosure of
        Client Data by Supplier personnel except (a) to provide the Momentum Services and
        prevent or address service or technical problems, (b) as compelled by law in
        accordance with Section 7.4 (Compelled Disclosure) below, or (c) as a Client or
        User expressly permit in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supplier may use service providers to perform the Services. Supplier will make
        commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that data transfers to service providers
        meet requirements applicable to Clients’ processing of data and will provide
        information on such data transfers in these Terms for Client’s consideration.

          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Using the Momentum Services</span>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.1 Establishing an Account</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Certain Features, functions, parts or elements of the Momentum Services can be
        used or accessed only by holders of an Account. The person who wishes to create an
        Account must:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>complete the sign-up form on the Web Site;</li>

        <li>accept these Terms by clicking “Sign up” or other similar button; and</li>

        <li>Client use of the Services.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Each Client may have only one Account. If several persons need to use an Account
        on behalf of Client, Client must designate such persons as Users. Each such User
        shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Client has designated Users and granted them Authorization, such Users will be
        deemed to be authorized to act on behalf of Client when using the Account.
        Supplier is not responsible for and shall have no liability for verifying the
        validity of Authorization of any User. However, Supplier may, in its discretion,
        request additional information or proof of the person’s credentials. If Supplier
        is not certain if a User has been granted Authorization, Supplier may, in its sole
        discretion, prevent such User from accessing the Momentum Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        A User may be associated with multiple Clients and Accounts. Deleting a User from
        one Account will not remove the User from the Platform if he/she is connected to
        multiple Accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Client and any User associated with an Account must provide Supplier with
        true, accurate, current, and complete information about the Client, Users or
        Account and keep it up to date.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.2 Logging Into an Account</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Client shall designate a username and password (“Login Credentials”) to be used to
        log in to its Account. These Login Credentials must not be used by multiple
        persons. If Client has designated several Users, each User will select separate
        Login Credentials. Client and each User are responsible for keeping confidential
        all login credentials associated with an Account. Client must promptly notify
        Supplier:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>of any disclosure, loss or unauthorized use of any Login Credentials;</li>

        <li>of a User’s departure from the Client’s organization;</li>

        <li>of a change in a User’s role in the Client’s organization;</li>

        <li>of any termination of a User’s right for any reason.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>5.3 Termination of Account</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Client may terminate these Terms at any time as provided in Section 16.</p>
      <p>
        Supplier shall permanently delete the Account within six months of the effective
        date of the termination. Account termination does not mean deletion of all Client
        data, which may be retained for the purposes set forth in Section 4.2 and Section
        7.4.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.4 Fees</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of an Account is subject to a Fee. Client Fees shall be determined by
        mutual written agreement as set forth in an applicable Service Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies or duties applicable under any
        applicable law, unless stated otherwise stated herein. Client is solely
        responsible for the payment of such taxes, levies or duties.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.5 Changing Plans</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any Client has the right to upgrade or downgrade a current Plan at any time by
        selecting a new Plan among the collection of Plans determined by the Supplier. In
        such an event, the Client’s credit card on file with the Supplier will
        automatically be charged with a Fee for the next payment interval with the rate
        stipulated in the new Plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Downgrading of the current Plan may cause the loss of Features, functionality, or
        capacity of the Account, as well as the loss of Client Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6. Payment</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.1 Payment Card Authorization</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Supplier may seek pre-authorization of Client’s payment card account prior to your
        purchase of Momentum Services in order to verify that the card is valid and has
        the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. You authorize such
        payment card account to pay any amounts as prompted, and authorize Supplier to
        charge all sums described in these Terms to such card account. You agree to
        provide Supplier updated information regarding your payment card account upon
        Supplier’s request and any time the information earlier provided is no longer
        valid.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.2 Direct Debit Payments</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In some markets Supplier may, if Client elects, request that Client complete a
        direct debit mandate to enable direct debit payments. In such cases Supplier shall
        comply with all applicable national rules and regulations related to direct debit
        payments.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use Stripe, Inc. to process your Direct Debit payments. More information on how
        Stripe, Inc. processes your personal data and your data protection rights,
        including your right to object, is available at
        https://support.stripe.com/search?q=data%20processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.3 Electronic Invoice</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If Supplier has not sought pre-authorization of your payment card, then before the
        end of each payment interval, Client will be issued an electronic invoice for
        payment of the Fee of the next payment interval. Client must pay the invoice by
        the due date indicated on the invoice.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.1 Uploading Client Data to Platform</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Client uploads Client Data to the Platform, such Client Data and any
        processing of such Client Data must be in compliance with these Terms and
        applicable law. All rights, title and interest in and to the Client Data belong to
        the Client or third persons (including Users) whether posted and/or uploaded by
        you or made available on or through the Momentum Services by Supplier. By
        uploading Client Data to the Platform, Client authorizes Supplier to process the
        Client Data. The Client is responsible for ensuring that:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          the Client and any of the Users associated with the Account do not create,
          transmit, display or make otherwise available any Client Data that violates
          these Terms, the rights of Supplier, other Clients or Users, or is harmful (for
          example viruses, worms, malware and other destructive codes), offensive,
          threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, invasive
          of another’s privacy, hateful or otherwise unlawful; and
        </li>

        <li>
          the Client and all of the Users associated with the Account have the necessary
          rights to use the Client Data, including to insert it into the Platform and
          process it by means of the Account.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>7.2 No Guarantee of Accuracy</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Supplier does not guarantee any accuracy with respect to any information contained
        in any Client Data, and strongly recommends that you think carefully about what
        you transmit, submit or post to or through the Momentum Services. You understand
        that all information contained in Client Data is the sole responsibility of the
        person from whom such Client Data originated. This means that Client, and not
        Supplier, is entirely responsible for all Client Data that is uploaded, posted,
        transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Momentum Services, as well as
        for any actions taken by the Suppliers or other Clients or Users as a result of
        such Client Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.3 Unlawful Client Data</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You will not use the Momentum Service in any way that violates these Terms or
        Client Data that in any manner is prohibited by law. Supplier is not obliged to
        pre-screen, monitor or filter any Client Data or its processing by the Client in
        order to determine if it is unlawful in nature. However, if the Supplier has
        reason to believe that the Client is processing unlawful Client Data, or the
        action of its processing is unlawful by in nature, Supplier has the right to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>notify the Client of such unlawful Client Data or sensitive;</li>

        <li>deny its publication in the Momentum Services;</li>

        <li>
          demand that the Client bring the unlawful Client Data into compliance with these
          Terms and applicable law;
        </li>

        <li>
          temporarily or permanently remove the unlawful Client Data from the Momentum
          Services, restrict access to it or delete it.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If Supplier is presented convincing evidence that the Client Data is not unlawful,
        Supplier may, at its sole discretion, restore such Client Data, which was removed
        from the Momentum Services, Account or access to which was restricted.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, in the event the Supplier believes in its sole discretion Client Data
        violates applicable laws, rules or regulations or these Terms, the Supplier may
        (but has no obligation), to remove such Client Data at any time with or without
        notice.

      <p>
        Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Better Good, Inc
        complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and will remove Client Data

        The Momentum Service is not designed to comply with industry-specific regulations
        such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or the
        Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), so you may not use the
        Momentum Services where your communications would be subject to such laws. You may
        not use the Momentum Service in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
        Act (GLBA).

      <p>
        <strong>7.4 Compelled Disclosure</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Supplier may disclose a Client’s confidential information to the extent compelled
        by law to do so. In such instance, Supplier will use commercially reasonable
        efforts to provide Client with prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the
        extent legally permitted) and Client shall provide reasonable assistance, at its
        cost, if Client wishes to contest the disclosure. If Supplier is compelled by law
        to disclose Client’s confidential information as part of a civil proceeding to
        which Supplier is a party, and Client is not contesting the disclosure, Client
        will reimburse Supplier for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure
        access to that confidential information.

        Features or functionality to be significantly excessive in relation to other
        Users, Supplier reserves the right to suspend respective Client Account, (or part

          Service or part or element of the Platform temporarily or permanently;
        </li>

        <li>
          taking such action as is necessary to preserve Supplier’s rights upon any use of
          the Momentum Services that may be reasonably interpreted as violation of
          Supplier’s intellectual property rights, distribution of Internet viruses,
          worms, Trojan horses, malware, and other destructive activities or illegal
          activity.
        </li>
      </ol>

        the effective date of the modification. The Client’s continued use of the Momentum
        Services, or any part or element thereof, after the effective date of a
        modification shall indicate its consent to the modifications. Supplier shall not
        be liable to the Client or to any third person for any modification, suspension or

        </li>

        <li>as otherwise specified in any applicable service agreement.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>16.3 Effect of Termination</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Upon termination of these Terms,</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Supplier shall deactivate and permanently delete the Account as set forth in
          Section 5.3.
        </li>

        <li>
          Client must:
          <ul>

              stop using and prevent the further usage of the Momentum Services,
              including, without limitation, the Platform;

            <li>pay any amounts owed to Supplier under these Terms; and</li>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>16.4 Remedies</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If Supplier terminates these Terms as a result of an uncured breach by a Client or
        User, Supplier is entitled to use the same or similar remedies against any other
        persons who use the Momentum Services in conflict with these Terms.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Supplier may also apply any other remedies
        available to it under the applicable law. Upon application of any remedies, the
        Client or User may lose Access or suffer a loss of certain Features, functions,
        parts or elements of the Momentum Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Supplier has reasonable grounds to believe that the Client’s or User’s use of
        the Momentum Services, including the Account may harm any third persons, Supplier
        has the right to take adequate measures under its control to prevent, stop and
        eliminate the harm, where possible, in order to protect those third persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Supplier has the right to suspend access to all or any part of the Service,
        including removing Content, at any time for violation of this Agreement or to
        protect the integrity, operability, and security of the Service, effective
        immediately, with or without notice. Unless prohibited by law or legal process or
        to prevent imminent harm to the Service or any third party, Supplier typically
        provides notice in the form of a banner or email on or before such suspension.
        Supplier will, in its discretion and using good faith, tailor any suspension as
        needed to preserve the integrity, operability, and security of the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>

          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Governing Law and Jurisdiction</span>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms (and any further rules, policies or guidelines incorporated by
        reference therein) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
        of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of
        law. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Client and Better Good, Inc, any
        dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the breach thereof, shall be
        governed by the terms set forth in this Section 17 Any dispute arising from or
        relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by
        arbitration in San Francisco, California, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules
        and Procedures of JAMS then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with
        substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract
        disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in
        accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. The prevailing party
        in the arbitration shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable
        expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees and all other
        expenses) incurred in connection therewith. Judgment upon the award so rendered
        may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such
        court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the
        case may be.

          18.
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>18.1 Relationship of the Parties</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The parties will act solely as independent contractors. These Terms shall not be
        construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture, fiduciary duty, or
        any other form of legal association between the Client and either Supplier, and
        the Client shall not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication,
        appearance or otherwise. These Terms are not for the benefit of any third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>18.2 Severability</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If any term, condition or provision of these Terms is held to be invalid,
        unenforceable or illegal in whole or in part for any reason, that provision shall
        be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the
        parties. The validity and enforceability of the remaining terms, conditions or
        provisions, or portions of them, shall not be affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>18.3 Entire Agreement</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms are the entire agreement between Client and Supplier regarding
        Client’s use of the Momentum Services and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
        agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject
        matter. Except as otherwise provided herein, no modification, amendment, or waiver
        of any provision of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by
        the party against whom the modification, amendment or waiver is to be asserted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>18.4 Assignment</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Client may not, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by operation of law
        or otherwise, assign or transfer these Terms or delegate any of its rights and/or
        obligations under these Terms without Supplier’s prior written consent. Any
        attempted assignment, transfer or delegation without such prior written consent
        will be void and unenforceable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Client, or its
        permitted successive assignees or transferees, may assign or transfer these Terms
        or delegate any rights or obligations hereunder without consent: (1) to any entity
        controlled by, or under common control with the Client, or its permitted
        successive assignees or transferees; or (2) in connection with a merger,
        reorganization, transfer, sale of assets or product lines, or change of control or
        ownership of the Client, or its permitted successive assignees or transferees.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>18.5 No Waiver</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Failure of either Party to exercise or enforce any provision of or any of its
        rights under these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of
        that or any other provision or right.
